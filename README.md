# CO2 Emission Prediction Project
## Overview
This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict CO2 emissions based on various features such as vehicle specifications, fuel type, engine size, etc.
## Overview
This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict CO2 emissions based on various features such as vehicle specifications, fuel type, engine size, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about vehicle CO2 emissions. The dataset is available in the file `co2.csv`.

## Files
- `co2.csv`: The dataset containing information about vehicle CO2 emissions.
- `Co2_emissions_EDA_&_ML.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building machine learning models using linear regression, multi-linear regression, and polynomial regression.


## Data Analysis
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
- Many visulations are used to understand the data well.

## Machine Learning Models
- Linear regression, multi-linear regression, and polynomial regression models are built to predict CO2 emissions.
- Regularization techniques such as Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet are applied to improve model performance and handle potential overfitting.

## Results
- The performance of the machine learning models is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, and others.
- The predictions of the models are compared with actual CO2 emissions to assess their effectiveness.
